Technical Test:
 
Please write a simple RESTful Web Service (Or if you are up for the challenge do this using GraphQL rather than as a RESTful service) that given two numbers will add them together and respond with the
result.
 
Rules:
 
1.         The RESTful (or GraphQL) Web Service must be written in either Java or Javascript
--> Used javascript
2.         Please use GitHub to store your code and submit a link to your GitHub repository for us to review
--> OK
3.         You do NOT need to write a client for this service
--> OK
4.         You must develop it using BDD and TDD i.e. you must write both acceptance tests and unit tests (PRIOR to writing the code)
--> Unit tests results are printed in the console when http://localhost:3001/sum is accessed.
--> **TD2 is expected to fail as the data used was a string
5.         Optionally: create a mock for your RESTful (or GraphQL) Web Service to write your automated tests against prior to writing the solution
--> data_request.json file contains test data parameters. We can add more tests to that.
6.         Remember that this is an Automation Tester role so the automated tests will be looked at closely
--> OK
